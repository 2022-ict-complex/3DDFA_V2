## Introduction

This work extends [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA), named **3DDFA_V2**, titled [Towards Fast, Accurate and Stable 3D Dense Face Alignment](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162.pdf), accepted by [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/). The supplementary material is [here](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162-supp.pdf). The [gif](./docs/images/out.gif) above shows a demo of the tracking result.
This repo is the official implementation of 3DDFA_V2.

Compared to [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA), 3DDFA_V2 achieves better performance and stability. Besides, 3DDFA_V2 incorporates the fast face detector [FaceBoxes](https://github.com/zisianw/FaceBoxes.PyTorch) instead of Dlib. A simple 3D render written by c++ and cython is also included. If you are interested in this repo, just try it on this **[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OKciI0ETCpWdRjP-VOGpBulDJojYfgWv)**! Welcome for valuable issues and PRs üòÑ

<!-- Currently, the pre-trained model, inference code and some utilities are released.  -->

## Getting started

### Requirements
See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), tested on macOS and Linux platforms. Note that this repo uses Python3. The major dependencies are PyTorch, numpy and opencv-python, etc.

### Usage

1. Clone this repo
   
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2.git
cd 3DDFA_V2
```

2. Build the cython version of NMS, and Sim3DR
<!-- ```shell script
cd FaceBoxes
sh ./build_cpu_nms.sh
cd ..

cd Sim3DR
sh ./build_sim3dr.sh
cd ..
```

or simply build them by -->
```shell script
sh ./build.sh
```

3. Run demos

```shell script
# 1. running on still image, four options: 2d_sparse, 2d_dense, 3d, depth
python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg

# 2. running on videos
python3 demo_video.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi

# 3. running on videos smoothly by looking ahead by `n_next` frames
python3 demo_video_smooth.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi

# 4. running on webcam
python3 demo_webcam_smooth.py
```

The implementation of tracking is simply by alignment. If the head pose > 90¬∞ or the motion is too fast, the alignment may fail. A threshold is used to trickly check the tracking state, but it is unstable.

You can refer to [demo.ipynb](./demo.ipynb) or [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OKciI0ETCpWdRjP-VOGpBulDJojYfgWv) for the step-by-step tutorial of running on the still image.

For example, running `python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg -o 3d` will give the result below:

## FQA

1. What is the training data?
We use [300W-LP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OEHD3T4eCkVGs0TkhUWFN6N1k/view?usp=sharing) for training. You can refer to our [paper](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162.pdf) for more details about the training. Since few images are closed-eyes in the training data 300W-LP, the landmarks of eyes are not accurate when closing.
